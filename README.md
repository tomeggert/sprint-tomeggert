## My Process

- I downloaded an HTML template file in which I could upload to a Github repository.
- I used this repository in Visual Studio Code where I edited details to customize the webpages text and images.
- Once this was completed, on Azure I created a static webpage which I could deploy to my updated Github Repository creating a .yaml file.
- - The website was also configured with a custom domain purchased and configured at [NameCheap](https://namecheap.com).
- The website was then checked for HTML and CSS validation.
- A part of this project also inlcuded connecting to Google Analytics to track user engagement and activity.
