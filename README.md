## What Did I Learn?

- I downloaded an HTML template file to quickly stand up an attractive portfolio web site.
- I edited the template to include my details, to add features that were not previously present, and to remove existing template features I did not plan to use.
- The files were validated to HTML5 and CSS3 stanards.
- The website was validated to WCAG2.1, level AA standards for accessibility.
- The website was deployed to Microsoft Azure cloud services as a static web application.
- The website was configured with a custom domain purchased and configured at [NameCheap](https://namecheap.com).
